# ESP32-e-Paper-Weather-Display
An ESP32 and a 2.9" ePaper Display reads Weather Underground and displays the weather

**OPEN WEATHER MAP VERSION**

This version requires *** Arduino JSON v5.13.2 ***

Go to Sketch > Include Library... > Manage Libraries.... Then, for each library, put its name into the text field to have its metadata pulled from the internet and displayed below. Select the latest version and install it. Make sure to come back to this dialog from time to time to keep each library up to date. Also make sure that you only have one version of each of the libraries installed.

'ESP8266 WeatherStation' by Daniel Eichhorn (required for additional fonts)
Download the software and install all 3 files in the same sketch folder.

1. ESP32_OWM_Current_Forecast_29_epaper_vX always choose the latest version
   ESP32_OWM_Current_Forecast_42_epaper_vX always choose the latest version
   ESP32_OWM_Current_Forecast_75_epaper_vX always choose the latest version

2. owm_credentials2.h

3. ArialRounded.h 

Obtain your OWM API key - it's free

4. Edit the owm_credentials2.h file in the IDE (TAB at top of IDE) and change your Language, Country, choose your units Metric or Imperial and be sure to find a valid weather station location on OpenWeatherMap, if your display has all blank values your location does not exist!.

**OPEN WEATHER MAP VERSION - STREAMING JSON**

This version requires *** Arduino JSON v6 or above *** it streams the Openweather and processes the data as received, rather than downloading all the data first, then decoding it. It uses a lot less memory this way.

Go to Sketch > Include Library... > Manage Libraries.... Then, for each library, put its name into the text field to have its metadata 

NOTE: See schematic for the wiring diagram, all displays are wired the same, so wire a 7.5" the same as a 1.54" or 2.9" display!

Compile and upload the code - Enjoy!
